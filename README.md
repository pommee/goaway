## üì¶ Installation

### Option 1: Docker Installation (Recommended)

**Quick Start:**

```bash
docker run -d \
    --name goaway \
    -p 53:53/udp \
    -p 53:53/tcp \
    -p 8080:8080 \
    pommee/goaway:latest
```

**Using Docker Compose (Recommended for production):**

Data will **not persist** unless volumes are used!

```yml
services:
  goaway:
    image: pommee/goaway:latest
    container_name: goaway
    restart: unless-stopped
    # volumes:
    #  - /path/to/config:/app/config  # Custom settings.yaml configuration
    #  - /path/to/data:/app/data      # Database storage location
    environment:
      - DNS_PORT=${DNS_PORT:-53}
      - WEBSITE_PORT=${WEBSITE_PORT:-8080}
    #  - DOT_PORT=${DOT_PORT:-853}  # Port for DoT
    ports:
      - "${DNS_PORT:-53}:${DNS_PORT:-53}/udp"
      - "${DNS_PORT:-53}:${DNS_PORT:-53}/tcp"
      - "${WEBSITE_PORT:-8080}:${WEBSITE_PORT:-8080}/tcp"
    #  - "${DOT_PORT:-853}:${DOT_PORT:-853}/tcp"
    cap_add:
      - NET_BIND_SERVICE
      - NET_RAW
```

### Option 2: Quick Install

**Quick Install Script:**

```bash
# Install latest version
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pommee/goaway/main/installer.sh | sh

# Install specific version
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pommee/goaway/main/installer.sh | sh /dev/stdin 0.40.4
```

The installer will:

1. Detect your operating system and architecture
2. Download the appropriate binary
3. Install it to `~/.local/bin`
4. Set up necessary permissions

**Manual Installation:**
Download binaries directly from the [releases page](https://github.com/pommee/goaway/releases).

### Option 3: Build from Source

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/pommee/goaway.git
cd goaway

# Build the frontend
make build

# Build GoAway binary
go build -o goaway

# Start the service
./goaway
```

### Option 4: Proxmox

If you are planning on running via Proxmox, then there is a helper-script available [here](https://community-scripts.github.io/ProxmoxVE/scripts?id=goaway), created by [Proxmox VE Helper-Scripts (Community Edition)](https://github.com/community-scripts/ProxmoxVE).  
Great alternative if you don't want to go through an as manual process and prefer not to use Docker.  
**Tip**: Once the LXC is up and running, logs can be found in `/var/log/goaway.log`. Login credentials can be found either in the log or `~/goaway.creds`.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Basic Usage

Start GoAway with default settings:

```bash
goaway
```

You'll see a startup message confirming the services are running:

![Startup Screen](./resources/started.png)

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> **First-time Setup:** GoAway runs in authenticated mode by default and generates a random password on first startup. This password is shown only once in the logs - make sure to save it!

### Accessing the Dashboard

1. Open your browser and navigate to `http://your-server-ip:port`
2. Default username: `admin`
3. Use the generated password from startup

### Configure Your Devices

To use GoAway as your DNS server, update your device or router settings:

**Router Configuration (Recommended):**

- Set your router's DNS server to GoAway's IP address
- This will protect all devices on your network

**Individual Device:**

- Update DNS settings to point to GoAway's IP address
- Primary DNS: `<goaway-server-ip>`
- Secondary DNS: `1.1.1.1` or `8.8.8.8` - Used as a fallback

### Command Line Options

```bash
goaway --help

GoAway is a DNS sinkhole with a web interface

Usage:
  goaway [flags]

Flags:
  -h, --help                       help for goaway
      --ansi                       Toggle colorized logs. Only available in non-json formatted logs (default true)
      --auth                       Toggle authentication for admin dashboard (default true)
      --dashboard                  Serve dashboard (default true)
      --dns-port int               Port for the DNS server (default 53)
      --dot-port int               Port for the DoT (DNS-over-TCP) server (default 853)
      --json                       Toggle JSON formatted logs
      --log-level int              0 = DEBUG | 1 = INFO | 2 = WARNING | 3 = ERROR (default 1)
      --logging                    Toggle logging (default true)
      --in-app-update              Toggle ability to update via dashboard
      --statistics-retention int   Days to keep statistics (default 7)
      --webserver-port int         Port for the web server (default 8080)
```

### Configuration File

Settings are stored in [settings.yaml](https://github.com/pommee/goaway/blob/main/settings.yaml). You can customize blocking rules, upstream DNS servers, and other options through the web dashboard or by editing this file directly.

### Examples

**Run on custom ports:**

```bash
goaway --dns-port 6121 --webserver-port 3000
```

**Disable authentication (not recommended for production):**

```bash
goaway --auth=false
```

**Enable debug logging:**

```bash
goaway --log-level 0
```

## üîß Development

### Running in Development Mode

The dashboard and server can be started separately for development with hot reloading:

```bash
# Start the web interface (with hot reload)
make dev-website

# Start the server (in another shell)
make dev-server
```

> **Note**: Primary testing is conducted on Linux (amd64). While the aim is to support all listed platforms, functionality on macOS and Windows may vary.

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Permission Denied (Port 53)**

- DNS servers typically require elevated privileges to bind to port 53

**Can't Access Dashboard**

- Check if port 8080 is available and not blocked by firewall
- Try accessing via `http://localhost:8080` on the same machine

**DNS Not Working**

- Verify GoAway is running and listening on the correct interface
- Check device DNS settings point to GoAway's IP address
- Test with `nslookup google.com <goaway-ip>` or `dig @<goaway-ip> google.com.`

## üìà Performance

GoAway is designed to be lightweight and efficient:

- **Memory Usage:** Typically < 50MB RAM
- **CPU Usage:** Minimal impact on system performance
- **Network:** Low latency DNS resolution
- **Storage:** Logs and statistics use minimal disk space
