## üîç Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Permission Denied (Port 53)**

- DNS servers typically require elevated privileges to bind to port 53

**Can't Access Dashboard**

- Check if port 8080 is available and not blocked by firewall
- Try accessing via `http://localhost:8080` on the same machine

**DNS Not Working**

- Verify GoAway is running and listening on the correct interface
- Check device DNS settings point to GoAway's IP address
- Test with `nslookup google.com <goaway-ip>` or `dig @<goaway-ip> google.com.`

## üìà Performance

GoAway is designed to be lightweight and efficient:

- **Memory Usage:** Typically < 50MB RAM
- **CPU Usage:** Minimal impact on system performance
- **Network:** Low latency DNS resolution
- **Storage:** Logs and statistics use minimal disk space
