api:
  # Port used for the API/web interface server.
  # Access the dashboard and management features through this port.
  port: 8080

  # Controls whether login is required to access the dashboard.
  # Will create an admin account of first startup (password can be seen in the logs).
  # Set to true for increased security.

# Enable or disable automatic updates for blacklists.
# If enabled, the server will check for updates to blacklists daily at midnight.
scheduledBlacklistUpdates: true

# Number of days to retain statistics and query logs.
# Lower values save disk space but provide less historical data.

# Toggles all logging when set.
# Useful for privacy-focused deployments or reducing disk I/O when disabled.
loggingEnabled: true

# Determines which severity of log messages to display.
# Each level includes all levels above it in number.
# 0 = Debug (most verbose, includes all messages)
# 1 = Info (normal operation messages)
# 2 = Warning (potential issues that don't affect operation)
# 3 = Error (serious problems only)
logLevel: 1

# Enables or disables in-app update functionality.
# Behavior depends on the deployment method (Docker vs standalone binary):
# Docker:
#   - inAppUpdate: false → Updates require stopping, removing, and pulling a new image manually.
#   - inAppUpdate: true  → The dashboard's built-in updater will fetch the latest binary and restart the container automatically.
# Standalone:
#   - inAppUpdate: false → Update manually via installer or `updater.sh`.
#   - inAppUpdate: true  → The dashboard's updater will install the new binary, but you'll need to restart the app manually.
inAppUpdate: false
