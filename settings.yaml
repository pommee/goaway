# Toggles all logging when set.

# Miscellaneous settings for various features.
misc:
  # Enables or disables in-app update functionality.
  # Behavior depends on the deployment method (Docker vs standalone binary):
  # Docker:
  #   - inAppUpdate: false → Updates require stopping, removing, and pulling a new image manually.
  #   - inAppUpdate: true  → The dashboard's built-in updater will fetch the latest binary and restart the container automatically.
  # Standalone:
  #   - inAppUpdate: false → Update manually via installer or `updater.sh`.
  #   - inAppUpdate: true  → The dashboard's updater will install the new binary, but you'll need to restart the app manually.
  inAppUpdate: false

  # Number of days to retain statistics and query logs.
  # Lower values save disk space but provide less historical data.

  # Enable or disable automatic updates for blacklists.
